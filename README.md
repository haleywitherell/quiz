# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

I created a coding quiz game for this assignment.

# Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

# HTML
- In my HTML I set up the overall structure of the quiz. 
- There are three parts. The intro page, game/quiz page and ending page.

*Disclaimer*

Knowing what I know now after a week of working on this project, I would have set this up completly different. Due to time I was not able to go back and start over when I realized the way I had my files set up was likely causing a majority of my errors and problems (as well as confusion & stress lol).  

If I was doing this again, I would compile all my HTML (and CSS) files into one document and use JS to display each section of my quiz in the correct order. 


# CSS
- I used CSS to style my quiz including colors, fonts, display and more.


# JS
- I used JS to get the quiz to function the way I wanted it to
- I used JS to get the quiz questions to show up and appear in a random order
- I used JS to get the timer to function and count down from 60 seconds
- I used JS to allow users to submit their name and time at the end of the quiz
